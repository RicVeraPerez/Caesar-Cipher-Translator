# Caesar-Cipher-Translator
This project is a web application built with React that allows users to encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique. Users can input plain text and select a shift value (between 1 and 25). The app automatically calculates and displays the encrypted version of the text in real time.

Main Features:

Dynamic text input using React

Shift selector to control the encryption

Real-time encryption as the user types or changes input

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters

Clean and minimalist interface for easy usability

Technologies Used:

React (with useState)

HTML5 & CSS3

Vite (for fast development and bundling)

Educational Purpose:

This project serves as a practical introduction to classical cryptography and React concepts like state management, forms, and functional logic.
