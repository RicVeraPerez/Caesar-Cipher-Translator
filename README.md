# Caesar-Cipher-Translator
This project is a web application built with React that allows users to encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique. Users can input plain text and select a shift value (between 1 and 25). The app automatically calculates and displays the encrypted version of the text in real time.
